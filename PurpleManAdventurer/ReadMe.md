Purple Man Advenuter!

Embark on an eerie joruney thorugh space collecting as many potion bottles you can.
Try to avoid the traps to avoid losing lives, you may not be able to come back. 

The map was downloaded from an online source, "https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/spelunky/sheet/153474/", where each tile shown in the game,
is an exact coordinate of the tile on the map.png.

For the sound, an eerie sound is played thorughout the game to simulate the emptyness of space. When the player collects a potion, another sound is played that 
is similar to an elixir sound. When the player jumps, a whoosh sound is played in refernece to the game be taken in space (jetpack or zero gravity sound).

The player sprite sheet is from Spelunky playable characters, same as where the map is from,"https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/spelunky/sheet/56410/", once I
got the sprite sheet of 'Meat Boy', and changed him to a purple character.

For the hardware portion of this project, the player uses an ardino board with a joystick and three red led lights attached to it. The player can move the joystick left or right, and click in the joystick to make the player jump. Whenever the player loses a life in the game, a red led light on the ardino board goes out.

For future development, I would like to make this a two player game with multiple levels, where the player collects all the potions on the map, before dying, to advance to the next level.
